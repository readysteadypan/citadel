                            <p>We are not an officially registered organization or association. The Ready Steady Pan Team contains rotating volunteer staff from around the world, most (if not all) choosing to stay anonymous. The actions or words of one member of staff are not representative of the league as a whole, and we cannot be held liable as an organization. Please respect our privacy, and the simple desire to bring to the TF2 community something we all enjoy with as little legal drama as possible.</p>
