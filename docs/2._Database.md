## Database setup and management. 


Citadel is using PostgreSQL as a database, we're going to add a new repository to install a recent version of Postgres easily.

```
sudo sh -c "echo 'deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ xenial-pgdg main' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list"
wget --quiet -O - http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install postgresql-common
sudo apt-get install postgresql-9.5 libpq-dev
```

* Access psql console:

`sudo -u postgres psql`

* Create a user to give your application an access to the database:

`CREATE USER citadel_dev WITH password 'foobar';`

We are going to use 3 databases for development, test and producion enviroments. You can either create them and grant privileges separately, or upgrade our user to a superuser and let rake take care of the database preparation:

```
ALTER USER citadel_dev WITH SUPERUSER;
```

To quit psql console, type `\q`


Now we need to point our application to the PostgreSQL server. Open your `/config/database.yml` and fill it in using the example below. Use the actual server address instead of "localhost" if you did set it up on a remove server:

```yml
default: &default
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: utf-8
  pool: 5
  username: citadel_dev
  password: foobar
  host: localhost
  port: 5432

development:
  <<: *default
  database: citadel_0

test:
  <<: *default
  database: citadel_1

production:
  <<: *default
  database: citadel_2

```

Once we are done with this, we can now create our databases:

`rake db:create`

And then load the schema into the database:

`rake db:schema:load`

Don't forget to fill in your Steam API key in `/config/secrets.local.yml` (there is an example file, you can simply copy and rename it and then change the API key to yours.
`secret_key_base` is used to generate cookies and other secrets based on this master key base. Changing it after you have users signed up will reset their authorization.)

We are now ready to run our application in development:

`rails s` 

If you are working on a remote server, you may need to bind to the default ip address - run your server with `rails s -b 0.0.0.0`

You can now open your browser and visit our application served locally with `localhost:3000` or `[server_ip]:3000`
