                <h2>Double Elimination</h2>
                <p>Double elimination is a confusing thing. We hope that this explanation makes it less confusing. For those who don’t know how a double eliminations bracket works, this article is for you. For everybody else, it’s the same system you already are familiar with (e.g.: in UGC playoffs).</p>
                <p><b>Note:</b>This system only applies to playoffs at the end of the regular season, where the top 16 teams of each region play off against each other to win placements.</p>
                <p>Rounds in playoffs consist of:</p>
                <p><code>R1, R1L, R2, R2L, R3, R3L, R3L2, R4, R4L, R4L2, R5, R5L2</code>
                </p>
                <p>We will use this notation to denote “a game that is played.</p>
                <p>Assume match days of Tuesday and Thursday (to make things easier, actual match dates might be different).</p>
                <h3>Week 1 Tuesday:</h3>
