                <p>Ready Steady Pan is a competitive 6v6 Team Fortress format revolving around the use of stock melee in the form of a frying pan. As both a fun format, and a way of introducing players to the 6v6 format and mindset, the basic requirement is for every player to have a Frying Pan equipped. Classes that cannot equip the pan are banned, i.e. Engineer and Spy, alongside Heavy and Medic for their high health and health regeneration abilities respectively.</p>
