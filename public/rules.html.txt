                            <p>You should have six players (the "core" team). You should have more, up to nine, to play as substitutes. If you are desperate, you may play with five, but no fewer.</p>

During Playoffs all Non-Rostered Players will require approval. Our intention with this rule is to put an emphasis on players being rostered and playing in the matches.</p>
                            <p>NOTE: If any issues arise from non-rostered players, such as discharge of a non legal weapon that hits a player, then the team captain will get an infraction.</p>

                            <p>The default match day for Season 4 is Friday at 9:30 PM (EST for NA, UTC-3 for SA, CEST for EU, AEST for AU/NZ), meaning if no other day is agreed on then Friday must be the day you play. Teams are required to use website Match Comms, as well as team captains communicating through steam to find a match time that works for both of them. Teams must do all in their power to play on the default or agreed upon day, and submit scores by the deadline. In the event that the team captain or member with leader permissions is unavailable for communication prior to a match, teams are required to delegate that responsibility to a co-captain and make the enemy team aware of this via Match Comms so the correct players can be contacted.</p>

Please use standard time zones according to your regions (NA uses EST, EU uses , and AU/NZ uses AEDT), and take note of the offset to your time zone and plan accordingly.</p>

			                  <li>
                            <p>You must be able to provide logs and STV. Logs should be provided in the Match Comms prior to submitting score, and the STV should be kept in case a moderator requests it.</p>

                            <p>Attack/Defend will played via Stopwatch. Win conditions of stopwatch are one team attacks a round, then teams automatically switch. The other team must attack and complete the map faster than the first team did to win, or else they lose. This is played best 2 of 3.</p>

                            <p>King of the Hill maps are won by the first to 3 points, Best of 5 points. If the time runs out before the end, then the team with the most points is declared the winner.</p>

                            <p>3CP/Push maps are won by the team to capture the most points when the timer runs out or the first to 3 points. If the scores are even at the end of the time limit, an infinite Sudden Death plays out. The winner is then the last team (member) standing, or the team to capture the last point.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p>Teams receive a maximum of three pauses in a match all adding up to a total of 15 minutes, preceded by a 15 second warning. If a team goes over this pause length or have been found to have abused pausing, then they will receive a warning. If it continues, then any punishments decided by staff will be issued.</p>

                            <p>Make reports, disputes, etc in a timely manner. Defaults will be called on Sunday if no match is played, or if no communications been made. If a team does not show up or muster the minimum number of players required (5, as anything less is an unreasonable disadvantage in this format) to play a match by 15 minutes beyond the agreed upon match time, ­the opposing team may request a forfeit, provided they have the minimum amount of players, and documented proof of having shown up. Additional evidence may be requested by staff, or the match rescheduled/more time granted during review of these types of forfeit requests. </p>

                            <p>If the enemy team leader does not post anything in Match Comms or responds to you on Steam by 9:30 PM Friday (EST for NA, UTC-3 for SA, CEST for EU, AEST for AU/NZ) which is the default match day, you can submit a "no-show forfeit", which is a 3-point default win for your team by reporting a forfeit for the enemy team when reporting score, and mentioning the reason in Match Comms. We use Match Comms to check if both team leaders agreed on the match time and date, so please note in it that you are going to report the enemy team's forfeit for not showing up before doing so. If neither team shows up or makes any attempt to contact each other or play a game, the match will be declared a technical forfeit for both teams, counting against both teams' number of allowed forfeits.</p>

                            <p>The maximum amount of forfeits a team can get before being forced to drop from the season is 3. Meaning if you forfeit a match 3 times you will be forced to bow out of the season and will not be eligible for any rewards.</p>

						            <li>
                            <p> Matches in which one team leaves completely while currently in progress will count as that team forfeiting the match entirely (including every point scored). If the match is substantially complete, the other team will be awarded full match points for the match only when the partial score is in the remaining team's favor.</p>
